  <div class = "paragraphs">
    <p>
    I have a background in computer animation. I worked at Magnetic Studios here in Nashville for the past three years, and I discovered that I really wanted/needed to learn programming. After a lot of thought, I decided to make my exit from the animation world and dive into the tech world. I have to say that the
    
    <a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/"> Nashville Software School</a> has been awesome so far.
